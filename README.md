About.
<br>
Hi everyone.
<br>
It's a project for myself, so I don't expect that someone will be interested in it. But...
I make this project, because I want to catalogize my genealogy data. I need to store information about every my ancestor and another people who lived with them.
I want to manage connections with people I added to my database.
I want to connect people with records from official archives.
I want to genereate Gedcom file with genealogy tree for very people in my database.
I want to watch my tree (very far future, although...) and keep updated information about my ancestors.
I want to know blank spaces in my ancestor's tree.
I want to calculate any hidden connections between my ancestors...
I want...I just want to manage information about my ancestors without any outer help.
It's possible that sometime this project will be useful for someone else, maybe when I add some new features about calculating something from gedcom. But now it's just for me.
Anyway You feel free to make any improvements you want (if you will find this file someday ;) ).
<br>
With best regards,
<br>
rlinosaur.
